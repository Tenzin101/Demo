                <h2>football</h2>
                <article>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the
                word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly
                called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and
                sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically
                American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby
                union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football
                codes".
                
                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of
                the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English
                public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power
                of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
                controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football,
                for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their
                heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football
                associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular
                team sports in the world.</article>

                <h2>table tennis</h2>
                <article>Table tennis (also known as ping-pong) is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface
                being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two,
                players take alternating turns returning a light, hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court
                using small rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick
                reaction and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis on spin, which can affect the ball's trajectory
                more than in other ball sports.
                
                Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of
                equipment, table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among
                players of all levels and ages.
                
                Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[3] with event categories in both men's and women's singles, and men's
                and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
                
                Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926, and specifies the
                official rules in the ITTF handbook.[4] ITTF currently includes 226 member associations worldwide.[5]</article>
